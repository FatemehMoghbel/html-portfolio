<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Fatemeh, 
  a 22-year-old from Iran, currently living in Stockholm.
  I'm studying pharmacy, but I've got this itch to dive into programming and web development. 
  It's like having two interests pulling me in different directions!
  there's something about coding and building websites that really grabs my attention.
  I think it's because I love the idea of creating something from scratch and seeing it comes to life online.
  I'm excited to explore this new path and see where it takes me!
  Finally, I would like to thank you for taking the time to visit my first website ever!:)</p>
